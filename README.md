# Advent Of Code 2023

In this repository, I'm solving the Advent Of Code 2023 puzzles in C, Python, C#, Rust, and Go. I might not be able to keep up with those other than Python and C# as quickly, as I am not as familiar with those languages. Solutions are organized by language, then by day. Given that the puzzles are released at midnight, I don't plan to compete for leaderboard spots. I just want to have fun and learn. Wish me luck!
